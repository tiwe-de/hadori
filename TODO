TODO/possible optimizations
===========================

* forget inode in to_link if link count is 1 before linking (might cause data
  loss if inode is reallocted to a file inside the tree(s) being scanned)
* more debug output when attributes mismatch in handle_file()
* perhaps use hash_map, hash_multimap for better performance?
